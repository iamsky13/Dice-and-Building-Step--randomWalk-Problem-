# Dice-and-Building-Step-Problem
Imagine you are walking up in building rolling a dice.

Rules:
For 100 times you throw a dice:
* If it's either 1 or 2 you will go one step down [1 step down]
* If it's either 3 or 4 or 5 you will go one step up [1 step up]
* If it's 6 you will role dice again and walk resulting no. of steps [1/2/3/4/5/6 steps up]
* You can't go below step 0
* You have 0.1% of falling down the stairs when you make move and falling down means you have to start again from 0.

__What are the chances that you will reach 60 steps high?__
